        <h2>Understanding Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.</p>
        <p>Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
        
        <h3>Where to Find Help</h3>
        <p>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, you can seek help through licensed therapists, local mental health organizations, or national helplines.</p>
